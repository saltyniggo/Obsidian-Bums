It has a unique `commit`-level review system and makes it easy for the users to check the updated code easily. Also, multiple reviewers can be added to make contributions.
- **Powerful** [[JIRA]] **Integration** - [[JIRA]] is one of the best tools to track bugs within the code. This tool can easily integrate Bitbucket and [[JIRA]]. Thus, enabling a user to freely track the issue status or the bug report, without leaving the current tool.
- **In-line Discussion** - In-line Discussion can be used to add inline comments and threaded conversations within the code snippet. Thus, making the reviewers and developers interactions better.

## Disadvantages of BitBucket

- BitBucket doesn’t have the same simplified PR management tools as other competitors.
- The private repositories are free for a team of 1 to 5 members. If the team is larger than 5, you have to pay for each additional team member.
- Sometimes integrated applications like *SourceTree* perform strange errors, causing loss of time.
- Bitbucket does not capture the details about the force push. There should be some way to capture the details of force push as force push deletes the history.
- There are some search-related issues when finding a particular file. First, you need to launch the repository and find it locally. It’s a bit long process.
