## Types of Web Hosting

1. **Shared Hosting**: In shared hosting, multiple websites share resources (such as disk space, bandwidth, and processing power) on a single server. It is a cost-effective option suitable for small websites with moderate traffic.
2. **Virtual Private Server (VPS) Hosting**: VPS hosting provides a virtualized server environment where multiple virtual servers are created within a single physical server. Each virtual server operates independently, offering greater control and flexibility compared to shared hosting.
3. **Dedicated Server Hosting**: With dedicated server hosting, an entire physical server is dedicated solely to one user or organization. It offers maximum performance, security, and customization options but tends to be more expensive than shared or VPS hosting.
4. **Cloud Hosting**: [[Cloud]] hosting utilizes a network of interconnected virtual servers to host websites. Resources are distributed across multiple servers, providing scalability, reliability, and redundancy. [[Cloud]] hosting is highly scalable and suitable for websites with fluctuating traffic levels.
