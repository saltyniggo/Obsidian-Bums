# What is the Dependency Inversion Principle?

## Keypoints of the DIP Principle

Most [[Introduction to Design Patterns|Design Patterns]] are build upon the DIP Principle. Dependency Inversion talks about the *coupling* between different classes or modules. It focuses on the approach that higher classes are not dependent on lower classes, instead upon the [[Abstraction|abstraction]] of those lower classes.

>*Any higher classes should always depend upon the abstraction of the class rather than the detail*

This reduces the coupling between the classes by introducing an [[abstraction]] between the layers.

## An Example of the DIP Principle

Say you are a manager having some persons as an employee of which some are developers and some are graphic designers and rest are testers. Now letâ€™s see how a naive design would look without any dependency inversion and what are the loopholes in that design.

This source code does lack the Dependency Inversion and it shows. Firstly it exposes everything about the lower layers to the upper layer, so there is no real [[abstraction]].
This results in a dependency where the manager must already know about the type of workers he may supervise. If a new type of worker comes under the manager, the whole class needs to be rejigged.

Implemented like this any other kind of employee can be added without making the manager explicitly aware of it.
