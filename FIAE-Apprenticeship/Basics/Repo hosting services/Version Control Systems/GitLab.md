## What is GitLab?

**GitLab** is a web-based [[Introduction to Git|Git]] repository that provides free open and private repositories, issue-following capabilities and wikis. It is a complete DevOps platform that enables professionals to perform all the tasks in a project—from project planning and source code management to monitoring and security. Additionally, it allows teams to collaborate and build better software. 

**GitLab** helps teams reduce product lifecycles and increase productivity, which in turn creates value for customers. The application doesn't require users to manage authorizations for each tool. If permissions are set once, then everyone in the organization has access to every component.

In 2017, **GitLab** announced that their code would become fully open-sourced under an *MIT License*.
