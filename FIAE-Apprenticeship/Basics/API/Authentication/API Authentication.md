# Why do I need Authentication?

## First, what is Authentication?

User authentication is a security process that covers all of the human-to-computer interactions that require the user to register and log in. Said more simply, authentication asks each user, “who are you?” and verifies their response.****

When a user registers for an account, they must create a unique ID and key that will allow them to access their account later on. Generally, a username and password are used as the ID and key, but the credentials can include other forms of keys as well.

Essentially, the user authentication process is what provides users repeat access to their own accounts while attempting to block any _unauthenticated_ users from gaining access. This means that User A can log in to their own account, while User B would be denied access. Conversely, User B could access their own account, while User A would be unable to.


## How does user authentication work?

When users want to gain access, they must prove that they are who they say they are. Most of the times the ID and key are enough to confirm the users identity, which will allow the system to authorize the user.


## Why is user authentication important?

Its a crucial part, because its a key step in the process that keeps unauthorized users from gaining access to sensitive data. A strengthened authentication process ensures that User A only has access to the information they need and can’t see the sensitive information of User B.


## The authentication methods

There are three types of authentication methods:
1. **Knowledge factors** - Factors the user must know in order to log in are considered a knowledge factor. This can be anything from a username, password, or pin number. The challenge with these factors is that they can be weak in terms of security because they can be shared or guessed.
2. **Possession factors** - Anything that the user must have in order to log in is known as a possession factor. One-time password tokens such as a Magic Link™, key fobs, ID cards, and physical tokens are all considered possession factors.
3. **Inheritance factors** - Using a person’s biological characteristics is known as an inheritance factor. Any biometric authentication process, such as fingerprint scanning and facial recognition, would fall into this category.
