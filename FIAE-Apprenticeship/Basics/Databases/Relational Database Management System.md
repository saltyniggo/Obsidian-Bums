## What are RDBMSes?

A **relational database management system** (**RDBMS**) is a collection of programs and capabilities that enable to interact with *relational databases*. **RDBMSes** store data in the form of **tables**, with most **RDBMSes** using [[Introduction to SQL|SQL]] to access the database. However, since [[Introduction to SQL|SQL]] was invented ==after== the initial development of the *relational model*, it is ==not== necessary for **RDBMS** use.

The **RDBMS** is the most popular database system among organizations across the world. It provides a dependable method of *storing* and I large amounts of data while offering a combination of *system performance* and *ease of implementation*.
