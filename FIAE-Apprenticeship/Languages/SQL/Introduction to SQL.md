## What is SQL ?

**SQL** stands for *Structured Query Language*. It lets you *access* and *manipulate* **databases**.
It also became a standard of the **American National Standards Institute** => *[[ANSI]]* in 1986, and of the **International Organization for Standardization** => *[[ISO]]* in 1987.
Most modern database systems base on **RDBMS**, which stands for [[Relational Database Management System]].

A **database** consists of one or more **tables**. A **table** is a collection of data entries and it consists of **columns** and **rows**. Every **table** is broken up into smaller entities called **fields**. A **field** is a **column** in a **table** that is designed to maintain specific information about every **record** in the **table**.

A **record**, also called a **row**, is each individual entry that exists in a **table**. 
A **column** is a vertical entry in a **table**, that contains all information associated with a specific **field** in a **table**

## SQL is a Standard - BUT ....

Although **SQL** is an [[ANSI]]/[[ISO]] standard, there are **different** versions of the **SQL** Language.
However, to be compliant with the [[ANSI]] standard, they all support at least the *major commands*, such  as ==**SELECT**==, **==UPDATE==**, **==DELETE==**, ==**INSERT**==, ==**WHERE**==, in a similar manner.
