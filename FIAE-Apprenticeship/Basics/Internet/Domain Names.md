# Domain Names

## What is a domain name?

A **domain name** is a string of text that maps to an alphanumeric [[IP|IP Address]], used to access a website from client software. In plain English, a **domain name** is the text that a user types into a [[Browsers|browser]] window to reach a particular website. For instance, the **domain name** for Google is ‘*google.com*’.

The actual address of a website is a complex numerical [[IP|IP Address]] (e.g. *192.0.2.2*), but thanks to [[DNS]], users are able to enter human-friendly [[IP|IP Address]] and be routed to the websites they are looking for. This process is known as a **DNS lookup**.

## Who manages domain names?

**Domain names** are all managed by **domain registries**, which delegate the reservation of **domain names** to *registrars*. Anyone who wants to create a website can register a **domain name** with a *registrar*, and there are currently **over 300 million** registered domain names.

## Whats the difference between a domain name and a URL?

A **uniform resource locator** (*URL*), sometimes called a web address, contains the domain name of a site as well as other information, including the **protocol** and the **path**. For example, in the **URL**  ‘https://cloudflare.com/learning/', ‘cloudflare.com’ is the domain name, while '[[HTTPS]]' is the protocol and ‘/learning/’ is the path to a specific page on the website.

## What are the parts of a domain name?

**Domain names** are typically broken up into two or three parts, each separated by a *dot*. When read right-to-left, the identifiers in domain names go from **most general** to **most specific**. The section to the right of the last dot in a domain name is the **TLD**. These include the ‘*generic*’ **TLDs** such as ‘.*com*’, ‘.*net*’, and ‘.*org*’, as well as country-specific **TLDs** like ‘.*uk*’ and ‘.*jp*’.

To the left of the **TLD** is the **second-level domain** (*2LD*) and if there is anything to the left of the **2LD**, it is called the **third-level domain** (*3LD*). Let’s look at a couple of examples:

For Google’s US domain name, ‘*google.com*’:

- ’.*com*’ is the **TLD** (most general)
- ’*google*’ is the **2LD** (most specific)

But for Google UK’s domain name, ‘google.co.uk’:

- ’.*com*’ is the **TLD** (most general)
- ’.*co*’* is the **2LD**
- ’*google*’ is the **3LD** (most specific)

## How to keep a domain name secure

Once a **domain name** has been registered with a **registrar**, that registrar is in charge of notifying the registrant when their **domain** is about to expire and giving them the chance to renew, ensuring they do not lose their domain name. In some cases, registrars will prey on their users’ expired domain names by buying those domains the second they expire and then selling them back to the original registrant at an exorbitant price. It is important to choose an honest and trustworthy registrar to avoid these kinds of predatory practices.
