# The MVVM Pattern
---

## What is the MVVM Pattern?

**MVVM**, short for *Model-View-ViewModel*, represents a paradigm shift in UI development, particularly in frameworks like [[Windows Forms]] and [[WPF]]. It builds upon the foundations laid by the well-known [[MVC Pattern]] and [[MVP Pattern]].

## Components:

The MVVM Pattern is characterized by its three core components:
- The Model
- The View
- The ViewModel
Analogous to its counterparts in other patterns, the Model encapsulates domain logic and data manipulation. It represents the underlying data structure and business logic, independent of the UI.
The View component is responsible for rendering the user interface elements and responding to user interactions. The View is "dumb," containing minimal logic beyond UI rendering.
The ViewModel acts as a mediator between the View and the Model. It exposes data and commands from the Model to the View, facilitating seamless data binding and interaction.
