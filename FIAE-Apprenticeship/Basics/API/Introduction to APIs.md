## What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is the interface between a client and a server. It receives the request of the client, tells the system what you want and sends the response from the server, back to the client.


## Advantages of APIs

Applications must be highly available, mostly error-free and easily maintainable. Splitting the application into multiple modules helps achieving this. APIs are responsible for the communication between these modules.
